</p>

Asembi helps a person slow down a difficult choice before making it permanent. Instead of giving one fast answer, it brings together four independent GPT-5.6 perspectives, lets the user correct the assumptions behind them, runs a challenge round, and produces a clear Decision Brief.

It does not decide a life for anyone. It helps make trade-offs, unknowns, evidence, and the next safest move easier to see.

## Why Asembi

- **Independent views, not one generic reply.** Countercase, Opportunity, Risk, and Human Factor each have a distinct job.
- **Assumptions are visible and editable.** The user can correct the record before the agents challenge one another.
- **The output is practical.** The final brief includes a recommendation, what could change it, a small evidence action, a guardrail, and a decision rule.
- **No key required to explore.** Example Mode is a complete, local walkthrough that judges can try immediately.

## How it works

1. **Frame the decision.** Choose an Open, Founder, Career, or Move template and describe the choice.
2. **Add only useful context.** Leave context off, add details manually, or use editable Auto-fill in Live mode.
3. **Read the first hearing.** Four perspectives stream their independent views one at a time.
4. **Correct the assumptions.** Keep, edit, or remove the assumptions that matter before continuing.
5. **Run the challenge round.** Each perspective responds to what the others missed.
6. **Act on the Decision Brief.** Copy or download the complete record, then use the evidence action and guardrail to guide the next move.

## Built with Codex and GPT-5.6

**GPT-5.6** is the live reasoning engine. Each council member and the Mediator call `gpt-5.6` through a server-side Vercel relay. Responses arrive through Server-Sent Events, so each agent appears as it is generated instead of all at once.

**Codex** was used to evolve the prototype into the current Flutter web experience: the live streaming flow, two-round council, editable assumption checkpoint, structured Decision Brief, transcript export, visual system, and deployment workflow.

The browser UI is built with Flutter. In Live mode, it sends a bounded request to `/api/deliberate`; the Vercel function keeps `OPENAI_API_KEY` on the server, forces streaming, and forwards the response to the app. Example Mode is scripted and makes no network request.

## Try it

### Example Mode — no API key needed

1. Open [asembi.vercel.app](https://asembi.vercel.app/).
2. Enter a decision, then select **Use example**.
3. Follow the first hearing, assumption check, challenge round, and final brief.

### Live GPT-5.6 Mode

Select **Use Live GPT-5.6** when starting a review. The app never asks a visitor to paste an API key into the browser.

## Run locally

### Prerequisites

- Flutter with Dart 3.12 or newer
- A Vercel project and `OPENAI_API_KEY` only if you want Live mode

### Run the built Example Mode

~~~bash
python3 -m http.server 4173 --directory public
~~~

Open `http://localhost:4173` and choose **Use example**.

### Develop the Flutter app

~~~bash
cd flutter_app
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
~~~

Build the deployable bundle after a change:

~~~bash
cd flutter_app
flutter build web --release --output ../public
~~~

### Enable Live mode on Vercel

1. Import this repository into Vercel.
2. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to the Vercel project environment variables.
3. Redeploy the project.

## Data and safety

- Example Mode is a fixed local walkthrough; it does not send a request.
- Live Mode sends the decision and optional context to the Vercel relay and OpenAI. Do not enter account details, personal identifiers, confidential customer information, or secrets.
- Asembi is a planning aid, not medical, legal, financial, tax, investment, emergency, crisis, or professional relationship advice.
- The council does not verify salary, offer, visa, housing, market, funding, customer, employer, or school claims. Verify important facts independently.
